# Project README

## Introduction

Hello, and welcome to this project's README! I'm excited to take you through the details of our first project, where we'll be building the HTML structure of a webpage based on a designer's file. This project focuses exclusively on creating the HTML structure, with no need for CSS or styling. Let's dive in!

## Project Overview

In this project, our main goal is to implement the HTML structure of a webpage, following the design provided in a Figma designer file. The emphasis here is on creating a structurally sound and semantically meaningful HTML document that accurately reflects the design's layout and content. Don't worry about styling just yet; we'll tackle that in future projects.

## Designer File

To access the designer file and all the design details, please follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Figma Page](https://www.figma.com/file/your-figma-link).
2. If your computer lacks the necessary fonts, you can download them here: [source-sans-pro](link-to-font) and [Spin-Cycle-OT](link-to-font).
3. Keep in mind that some values in the designer file may be in float format; you're welcome to round them as needed.

## Getting Started

To get started on this project, follow these initial steps:

1. Duplicate the designer file to your drafts in Figma. This will give you easy access to all the design specifics.
2. Thoroughly review the designer file to gain a clear understanding of the layout and content structure.
3. Begin building the HTML structure, using the provided design as a reference.

## HTML Structure

Your primary task for this project is to create an HTML structure that accurately mirrors the designer's file. Here are some guidelines to help you along the way:

- Utilize appropriate HTML tags for headings, paragraphs, lists, and other content elements.
- Take the page layout into consideration and use container elements when necessary.
- Ensure the order of content matches that of the designer file.
- Remember, we're focusing solely on the HTML structure for now. CSS and styling will come later.

## Submission

Once you've completed the HTML structure for the webpage, you're ready to submit your project. Be sure to:

- Organize all HTML files in a folder named "project1" within your project directory.
- Double-check that your HTML structure faithfully replicates the designer's file.
- Keep your code well-organized and in line with best practices for HTML.
